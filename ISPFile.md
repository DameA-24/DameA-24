**FIBONACCI SEQUENCE GENERATOR**

The aim of this project is to create a program that provides the fibonnaci sequence starting from 0 to the desired length of the user. 

**Description**

 In the fibonacci sequence the last number in the sequence is added to the preceeding number. 
 This project prompts the user for the length of sequence they want and generates the digits starting from zero.
 
_This program does not requie additional libraries; however a Windows software greater than 10 is recommended._
_As no files are opened in the program, it can be run within any directory_

**Executing Program**

Upon running the program prints a welcome message then asks the user the desired length of the sequence.

The user should input a length between and including 0 - 50. 

_Should the length exceed this range an error message will be printed_

The user should enter an integer between and including 0 - 50.

 _Should the length not be an integer an error message will be printed_

The program will continuosly ask for a desired length until a valid input is received.
Upon receiving the valid input the generated sequence will be printed.
